# Front-End HTML & CSS Project: Japanese Sushi Restaurant Website

Welcome to this repository featuring a front-end project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases various web development concepts by creating a website for a fictional Japanese sushi restaurant based in Tokyo, Japan, which offers online ordering and delivery services.

**Project Focus:**

* **Theme:** A modern and engaging website for a Japanese sushi restaurant.
* **Functionality:** Designed to showcase the menu, provide information about the restaurant, and potentially handle online orders/delivery requests (depending on the JavaScript implementation).

While the current theme is a Japanese sushi restaurant, the underlying code structure and design principles are highly adaptable. You can easily modify this project to create websites for other types of restaurants, such as:

* Burger Restaurants
